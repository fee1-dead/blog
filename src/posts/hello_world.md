This will be my blog now. Inspired by the [`dtolnay` crate],
I have created a crate myself just like his, but automated using a build script.

The build script was initially 103 lines, but I plan on adding more features.
(but wow, 103 lines! to make a "rustdoc themed" blog)

Planned:
 - Post metadata: author, date (first published and last edited), etc.
 - RSS feed
 - Bloated buildscript
 - More posts

That's all. If you want to know what it does, just look at the [source code].
